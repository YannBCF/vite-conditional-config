## vite-conditional-config

### How to use

Run the command ``npm run build --mode=<mode>``

If you insert a wrong / unknown config mode argument the process will exit and bring an error, you can edit the config modes and build your own configs in the ``Configs`` class

### Colorette dependency

I allowed myself to use it since it is a vite dependency anyway, no worries
